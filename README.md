To view the presentation natively you need the present tool.

    go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present

Then run the `present` command in the current directory and open the [presentation URL](http://127.0.0.1:3999/autospoting.slide#1)


For convenience I also generated a PDF, but that was converted afterwards and may not match what was presented during [my talk](http://www.meetup.com/golang-users-berlin/events/230717720/).
